# DeDucklet Version: 1.0

This is an app that I started around April. It was a project to keep me busy
during quarantine. It is a app based around DeDucking and Stack Overflow.

Term - DeDucking:
This term is used when you are de-bugging your application and you talk to an
inanimate object. You read your lines of code out loud while thinking of what it
should be doing. In doing this, it allows the person de-bugging to find the
problems and a solution faster.

Stack Overflow:
Is a website where people can go to post questions and others answer their
coding questions. It is a great resource if you have an error or problem in your
code.

Please use this responsibly and remember that this is a work in progress. Any
questions please leave a comment.

Thanks,
IvoryCoding
